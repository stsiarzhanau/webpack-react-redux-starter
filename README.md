# DEPRECATED

This starter was created at the beginning of 2017. Currently, it is not relevant, because there are more modern tools that allow you to achieve a higher level of developer experience with a much simpler setup. So, I keep this repo in the public archive exclusively as a "museum exhibit" of how things were in the past.

# webpack-react-redux-starter

:rocket: Modern starter kit for React projects.

## Features

- **Every** dependency in project devDependencies is listed in the README and has a description with it's **purpose** explanation
- Not too complex, but at the same time not oversimplified
- Only cutting-edge technologies
- Great developer experience:
  - **Advanced live reload** (with **Hot Module Replacement** :heart:) on every file save
  - **Unit testing changed and affected files** with **[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)** on every file save
  - **Syncronized browser testing support** with **[Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)**
- Assets pipeline

> _NOTE: Not intended for isomorphic apps!_

> _NOTE: Work in progress. See [TODO](#todo)_

## Prerequisites

You should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Optionally you can install and use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as package manager, but it's possible to use **npm** instead, which ships with **Node.js**.

## Installation

- Clone this repo with **`git clone https://github.com/stsiarzhanau/webpack-react-redux-starter`** or (if you don't use Git) just click on the green **Clone or download** button and then on **Download ZIP**
- Unzip downloaded file (if you have used 2nd option)
- Open terminal and [go to the project's root folder](http://www.wikihow.com/Change-Directories-in-Command-Prompt) (**webpack-react-redux-starter**)
- Run **`npm install`** (or **`yarn install`**) to install project dependencies

## Usage

- Run **`npm start -s`** (or **`yarn start`**) to start development server

  > _NOTE: The `-s` flag is optional. It enables silent mode, which suppresses unnecessary messages from npm, and so we get cleaner output._

- Open **index.js** file in **src/ui/components/NavLinks** folder and follow instructions to see how syntax errors are being handled and watch **Hot Module Replacement** in action
- Open **index.test.js** file in **src/ui/components/NavLinks** folder and follow instructions to see how Mocha reports about failed unit tests
- Open **styles.css** file in **src/ui/components/NavLinks** folder and play with CSS to see how style changes are hot reloaded on file save without full page refresh
- Stop development server

  > _NOTE: In most cases it could be done by hitting `Ctrl+C` in the terminal_

- Run **`npm run build -s`** (or **`yarn build`**) to bundle project.
- Run **`npm run start:prod -s`** (or **`yarn start:prod`**) to serve files from **build** folder, so you can test production version of the app.
- If build was successful, `webpack-bundle-analyzer` will start to serve report file at `http://127.0.0.1:8888`. You can go to that address in the browser to look at and analyse bundle structure.

| [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)                                                                     | It's an incredibly configurable multi-purpose tool which do a lot of useful things. Out of the box it just bundles our JavaScript and JSON files (though do it extremely well). But with the help of **plugins** and **loaders** it can handle other file types too. So we can easily implement full **assets pipeline**. Also, in most cases, with the help of **npm scripts** it can be a good substitution for **task runners** (such as **gulp** or **Grunt**). Moreover, when combined with additional packages (such as [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server), [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) or **browser-sync** (with the help of **webpack-dev-middleware** in the last two cases)), it can provide us with super handy development environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [browser-sync](https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync)                                                       | This package provides us with a server which we use to serve our files during development. It also starts to serve our production files from **build** folder when we successfully bundle our project with **`npm run build -s`** (or **`yarn run build`**) command. The main advantage of using **browser-sync** over servers like **express** is that it can sync multiple browsers. It means that, when we have multiple browsers opened and make some interactions in one of them (like scrolling, for example), we can see the result of that interaction in other browsers too (which is really great feature for **cross-browser testing**). Moreover, it can sync browsers not only on the same machine but also on all devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. So, we can, for example, test how our responsive design looks simultaneously on desktop, laptop, as well as on different tablets and phones. **NOTE: It seems, that desktop can't use a wired connection that routes to the Wi-Fi network. Both desktop and mobile must be on Wi-Fi.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [webpack-dev-middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware)                                       | This package is a glue between **browser-sync** (or any other server that we use instead) and **webpack**. One of it's cool features is that files emitted from webpack during development aren't being written on disk and can be served directly from the memory, which is much faster approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [webpack-hot-middleware](https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware)                                     | This bit of software allows us to use (with **webpack-dev-middleware**) really awesome webpack feature: **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**. It's sort of better **live reload**. When we update some code and save our file, we can immediately see those changes in a browser. Moreover, it happens without full page reload, cause only changes that affect updated module (file) are being injected. Another cool feature that **webpack-dev-middleware** gives to us is an overlay with error messages which appears in our browser window when any error occurs.

| [@babel/preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-env)                         | Out of the box (if we didn't provide any **plugin** or **preset**) Babel will just parse our ES6+ code to some structure known as **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** and then generate it back. Output code will be the same as input code (ES6+). As we want to transform ES6+ to ES5 we need to include **transformers (plugins)** that will transform ES6+ code parsed by Babel compiler before it will be generated back. **Preset** is a collection of plugins. **babel-preset-env** includes all plugins that provide transformations for standardized ES6+ features (that are in ES2015, ES2016, ES2017... specs). But you can configure it to only include the polyfills and transforms needed for the browsers you support. Compiling only what's needed can make your bundles smaller and your life easier..

By default, that treemap representation will be automatically opened in default browser when webpack finishes bundle compilation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

It not only helps to keep our code clean and consistent, but prevents many possible errors which can break our app. To check any given file(s) you can run **`eslint`** command with path(s) to the file(s) and optional arguments (see [ESLint CLI reference](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface)) from command line. If your code has any stylistic issues you'll see ESLint messages in your console window. This starter kit also has preconfigured `eslint` **npm script**. If you run **`npm run eslint`** (or **`yarn run eslint`**) command it will check all files located in **src**, **tools**, and **config** folders, as well as in the root of your project. This project sticks to [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) (with the help of **eslint-config-airbnb** package), but you can easily override any [rules](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/) in **.eslintrc.js** file (which is located in the project root) or just use another style guide that better fits your needs and habits. It also worth mentioning that ESLint itself (not only it's rules) is [highly configurable](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) tool.                                                                         |

We don't need to use **babel-eslint** if we are using ES2015 (ES6), ES2016 (ES7) or ES2017 (ES8). ESLint actually supports ES2015/ES2016/ES2017, JSX, and _object rest/spread_ by default now. But as we use **babel-preset-stage-3** (and probably you'll want to try other experimental features) I've included this package into the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| [eslint-import-resolver-webpack](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/tree/master/resolvers/webpack) | When we bundle our code with webpack it's possible to simplify file paths in our **ES6 import statements** (due to resolver library that webpack uses under the hood, and `resolve` configuration object settings in webpack config). For example, we can omit the file extension and part of the file path (just use `import Button from 'components/button'` instead of `import Button from './src/components/button/index.js'`). But with such approach we'll end up with lint errors from **eslint-plugin-import**, cause it will think that we probably misspell path to our module. **eslint-import-resolver-webpack** provides **eslint-plugin-import** with information about our `resolve` settings to prevent false-positive lint errors and warnings. **NOTE: We need to configure this package settings in our _.eslintrc.js_ file (see package README).**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

But testing in browsers is relatively slow (partly because of slow speed of **Document Object Model (DOM)** interface). **jsdom** is a lightweight and fast JavaScript implementation of DOM for Node.js which allows our Mocha tests to run much faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

But it allows us to use any **assertion library** that we want.

| [react-test-renderer](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-test-renderer)                 | This package provides an experimental React renderer that can be used to render React components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment. Essentially, this package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the "DOM tree" rendered by a React DOM or React Native component without using a browser or jsdom. We should install this package in addition to **enzyme** (as well as **react-dom**) so enzyme can work properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)                                                                        | This package is another React-specific testing utility. It's built on top of **react-dom/test-utils** and **react-test-renderer**, but with Enzyme it's much easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse React components' output. Enzyme's API is meant to be intuitive and flexible by mimicking jQuery's API for DOM manipulation and traversal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

When in our code we refer to some asset (for example _logo.png_), **file-loader** copies that _logo.png_ file into output directory (**build**) and creates an entry with path to this file inside of resulting bundle (**bundle.js**). So, our production code in resulting bundle, which needs the _logo.png_, knows where to find that image. **file-loader** can be configured through options.

If file size of some asset is smaller than a specified limit (in bytes) this loader can just inline it into resulting bundle as **base64 encoded Data URI**. Otherwise file will be automatically processed by the **file-loader**. Such an approach allows us to save some additional HTTP requests, but also increases resulting bundle size. So we should specify the right limit to observe balance. We can pass to **url-loader** all the options of **file-loader** and, of course, **limit** option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It takes project's CSS code and injects it into the resulting bundle together with some JavaScript code that wraps that CSS into `<style>` tag and then dynamically (on runtime) injects that `<style>` tag into markup (**index.html**). Such approach is good for development, as it allows styles to be hot reloaded without full page refresh (thanks to **Hot Module Replacement**). For production build it's better to use **mini-css-extract-plugin** (which generates separate CSS bundle(s)) instead of the **style-loader**. Also it's worth mentioning that **style-loader** should be used together with other loaders (usually **css-loader**) that will actually transform CSS, so it could be injected into resulting bundle. **style-loader** is just responsible for injecting itself. **style-loader** have some options. To read more about possible options see package README.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader)                                                       | It's possible just to convert CSS into string (with [raw-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/raw-loader)) and then pass it to **style-loader**. The latter will inject that CSS string into JS bundle and our CSS will work as expected. But if our CSS code contains some "calls" to assets inside CSS files (like `@import 'style.css'` or `background: url(path/to/asset.js)`) those assets will be unaccessible. It happens cause they were not actually required by webpack and so neither copied into otput directory nor inlined into resulting bundle. **css-loader** solves that problem. It finds all those `@import`'s and `url()`'s in CSS code and **require** assets they point to. Then appropriate loaders (like **url-loader** or **file-loader**) do their job (see above) and we have our assets inlined into JS bundle or copied into **build** folder. We can also extend **css-loader** functionality (through it's options). For example, we can enable [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) support or minification. To read more about possible options see package README. If you are not familiar with **CSS Modules** take a look at [this](http://andrewhfarmer.com/what-are-css-modules/) article and also at [this](http://andrewhfarmer.com/css-modules-by-example/) one. |
| [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin)                             | This plugin is useful for production builds. Instead of inlining CSS code into resulting JavaScript bundle (like **style-loader** does) it creates separated CSS bundle file(s). If our total stylesheet volume is big, it will be faster because the CSS bundle is loaded in parallel to the JS bundle. _Before webpack v4 [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin) was used instead_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| [optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/NMFR/optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin)                  | This plugin uses **css-nano** internally and allows to minify css assets in production mode. Comparing to using **css-nano** as **PostCSS** plugin with **post-css-loader** it minifies the whole bundle(s) instead of separate chunks which could be potentially faster and with a smaller result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

For example, NODE_ENV, which we use to tell webpack and friends in which environment (development or production) given command should run. But in different OS we have to set it in a slightly different way. For UNIX based OS we shoud use syntax like `NODE_ENV=production`. For Windows - `set NODE_ENV=production`. **cross-env** package allows us to set environment variables in Unix style and have it work on Windows too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

For example, we can write `run-p serve:src test:watch` instead of `npm run serve:src & test:watch`. So, with **npm-run-all** our **npm scripts** not only look more concise, but work fine on Windows (which treats **`&`** operator in a different way than UNIX based OS).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Acknowledgements

This project is inspired by Cory House [coryhouse/react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot)

Some ideas are taken from following starter kits:

- Michael Pevzner [mihap/webpack-react-hot-bolerplate](https://github.com/mihap/webpack-react-hot-bolerplate)
- Dmitriy Haponov [sunstorymvp/playground](https://github.com/sunstorymvp/playground)

Juho Vepsäläinen ["SurviveJS - Webpack"](http://survivejs.com/webpack/introduction/) book was a huge help.

## TODO

- [ ] Add an example app that will utilize such technologies as:
  - [ ] react-router v4
  - [ ] redux
  - [ ] redux-saga
- [ ] Write test suites that will demonstrate all test tools, which are used in the project, in action
